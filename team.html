  <h1>The birth of Fate&Fortune</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Fate&Fortune is our submission to Hack the North 2021. We wanted to create a game <br> that combines the use of Voiceflow and the concept of adventure role-playing games. <br> We chose to make the main character a knight because we wanted to stick with a <br> simple structure of an adventure game. However, this does not mean Fate&Fortune <br> is just your generic adventure game. Our gameplay and our implementation of Voiceflow <br> is what makes the game truly stand out among all adventure role-playing games.
  </p>

  <h1>Games that inspired us</h1>
  <br>
  <p>As role-playing game lovers, Fate&Fortune was inspired by many great games out there. <br> The character of the knight was inspired by Guardian Tales by Kakao Games, <br> our all time favourite adventure role-playing game. The decision-making <br> concept in our game was inspired by Choice Game Library by Delight Games. <br> Thanks to these two outstanding games, we were able to create Fate&Fortune.</p>
